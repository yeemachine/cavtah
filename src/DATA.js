    '{{H:CAVTAH}} is a new initiative that seeks to address fundamental challenges in art history, advancing existing visual technologies through innovative uses of reproductions in relation to the content and connections among artworks. We live at a time of the proliferation of new technologies of the most elaborate kinds. Yet despite or precisely because of these myriad possibilities, simpler issues have been overlooked. When you encounter a {{A:Rembrandt}} painting in a museum, is it really a Rembrandt, and how would you know? No previous scholar, book, or exhibition has ever sought to present Rembrandt’s oeuvre in work-by-work order as a means to follow his gradual development through visual connections among his paintings (etchings, drawings), also in relation to his followers’ works erroneously attributed to him. CAVTAH provides visual catalogues and what André Malraux, pioneering theorist of reproductions, called “imaginary museums,” seemingly three-dimensional, museum-like environments, to reveal connections among artworks and their meaning that potentially everyone can see and understand.{{F:1}} The works of other artists such as {{A:Johannes Vermeer}}, Carel Fabritius, {{A:Jan van Eyck}}, and Robert Campin can also be clarified in this way. CAVTAH further offers reconstructions of the complex genesis of individual paintings (Campin’s {{A:Mérode Altarpiece}}) and the original state of paintings that survive in fragmentary forms (Rembrandt’s {{I:Oath of the Batavians}}, Van Eyck’s {{I:Ghent Altarpiece}}).',
   '{{H:Rembrandt}} was an exceptionally skilled painter and his works are outstanding in quality. Yet monetary and cultural investment in his name has contributed to inflation of the number of paintings assigned to him, primarily involving his followers’ paintings emulating his example. The result has been misunderstanding and devaluation of Rembrandt’s oeuvre. CAVTAH seeks to shift the emphasis from abstract monetary and cultural investments to concrete artistic qualities: the distinctive characteristics of Rembrandt’s paintings, his gradual development, and his exchanges with followers whose paintings were mistakenly assigned to him. The earliest connoisseurs [“those who know”] made subjective judgments about paintings based on their personal encounters with hundreds of works around the world. They likely also referred to black and white photographs they collected, such as those that constitute Abraham Bredius’ pioneering 1925 catalogue of 630 Rembrandt paintings.{{F:2}}  Bredius wanted to include as many “Rembrandts” as possible, several of which he had purchased for the royal Mauritshuis Museum or his own collection. His catalogue grouped these paintings, including many variations in different styles on the same subjects or compositions, in broad categories. Horst Gerson’s 1969 revision of Bredius’ catalogue retained the same format, yet “de-attributed” 56 paintings to the back of the catalogue, at least one of which was certainly by Rembrandt.{{F:3}}',
   'Partly in response to these circumstances, around the time of Gerson’s revision, the {{I:Rembrandt Research Project}} (RRP) a group of scholars supported by the Dutch government for almost a half-century (1969-2015), began to conduct technical examinations of paintings in Bredius’ catalogue.{{F:4}} The RRP initially made a revision of Rembrandt’s oeuvre a prominent part of the publicity for their {{I:Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings}}, and caused some controversy by de-attributing paintings from Rembrandt, although they did not explicitly re-attribute these to other artists. Yet the team members espoused conflicting views, changed their conclusions about many paintings, including famous ones, in subsequent volumes, and progressively assigned ever more disparate works to Rembrandt that were never previously assigned to him. They eventually abandoned their irrelevant “A,” “B” and “C” categories, and acknowledged that technical data was inconclusive for attributing paintings to Rembrandt. Yet they did not offer alternative methods. The sixth and last volume of their {{I:Corpus}} with a catalogue of all of Rembrandt’s paintings does not provide an overview or explanation of their changing conclusions, and errs as much if not more than previous scholars in the inflation, devaluation, and confusion of paintings assigned to Rembrandt. Like Bredius and others, the RRP continued to make judgements about whether or not individual paintings were “authentic” Rembrandts, an approach that both reflected and reinforced investment in his name.{{F:5}} The difficulty does not involve forgeries or “inauthentic” Rembrandts. Rather, authentic paintings by Rembrandt’s followers are mistakenly assigned to Rembrandt.',
   'Unlike Bredius, the RRP published color photographs, yet rarely discussed or visually compared these. The closest they came to visual technologies were the summaries of their conclusions in “annexes” on a separate (fold-out) sheet in a pouch at the back of the first four {{I:Corpus}} volumes. The annexes made an incremental improvement on Bredius’ catalogue by grouping together all the paintings for individual periods, rather than in separate categories. Yet they were undermined by the RRP’s subsequent changed conclusions and were not included in the electronic versions of the Corpus, and still consisted of black and white photographs, neither in scale, nor in chronological order. The RRP asserted that “what one cannot do is to establish the chronology of those paintings which Rembrandt made within any particular year.”{{F:6}} The claim is both false and true. False insofar as it is impossible {{I:not}} to put any group of paintings assigned to Rembrandt in some order, either as a written list or a visual catalogue (5). True insofar as it is impossible to put the paintings the RRP or their predecessors assign to Rembrandt in a coherent work-by-work order, simply because many of these are not by Rembrandt.',
   'CAVTAH submits: one not only {{I:can}} establish the chronology of Rembrandt’s paintings in any particular year, but also {{I:must}} do so in order to determine which paintings he made. The task begins with his paintings from his earliest period in his hometown of Leiden (1625-1631), presented in chronological, work-by-work order, relative scale, and color, in the CAVTAH imaginary Rembrandt museum, with links to related issues. For each year during Rembrandt’s Leiden period we can follow the concrete relations between his previous and subsequent paintings, as well as his drawings and etchings, his exchanges with other artists, and historical events. Paintings (and drawings) mistakenly assigned to Rembrandt further need to be reassigned to his students in this period: primarily Gerard Dou and Isaac Jouderville, and Rembrandt’s rival turned follower Jan Lievens.'
